# Basic
PART 1

THEORY

A Hello World program in C++ is a simple and classic introductory program commonly used to learn the basics of C++ programming. The C++ hello world program's objective is to provide you with a fundamental grasp of C++ functions and syntax. Beginners can use the hello world programme as a jumping-off point to become familiarised with the syntax and structure of the C++ programming language.

ALGORITHM

1.#include : This line includes the Input/Output Stream library, which provides functions like cout and endl for input and output operations.
2.int main() { ... }: This is the main function of your C++ program. 
3.std::cout: This is the standard C++ output stream, which is used to display output on the console.
4."Hello, World!": This is the text you want to print. It is enclosed in double quotation marks to represent a string.
5.<<: This is the output stream operator, used to insert the string "Hello, World!" into the std::cout stream.
6.return 0;: 
7.Compile and run this code, and it will print "Hello, World!" to the console.

EXPECTED OUTPUT

HELLO WORLD
My first program

PART 2

THEORY

Nowadays, calculators are a common gadget. It makes calculations easier and faster. Everyone uses calculators on a regular basis. A C++ programme can be used to create a basic calculator that adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides two operands that the user enters.

ALGORITHM

1.Start
2.Initialize two float variables to take two operands as input.
3.for sum, add 1st and 2nd number.
4.print the solution.
5.for difference, subtract 1st and 2nd number.
6.print the solution.
7.for mulplication, multiply 1st and 2nd number.
8.print the solution.
9.print the solution.
10.End

EXPECTED OUTPUT

enter first number5
enter second number5
the sum of two numbers is 10
enter first number5
enter the second number5
the subtration of two number is 0
enter the first number2
enter the second number2
the multiplication of two number is 4
